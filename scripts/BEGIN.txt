You wake up in a damp cave...\n 
A dim light is glowing in the distance 
You can't make out your surroundings so you walk towards the light 
A terrible stench attacks your senses as you walk towards entrance 
It is almost unbearable\n 
As you approach the light you notice bruises on your arms\n 
It has been a painful trip, but you remain determined to keep moving forward\n 
As you near the dimly lit room you take a moment to survey the surroundings before stepping out of the shadows\n\n

The room is empty,
But an unmistakable odour makes it cler you are still not safe

You take a moment to see what is left of the equipment you came with

All thats left is a small ornate knife that you had tucked in your pants

It looks like the wretches took everything else that you had 
You sigh a breath of relief 
\n

The knife brings back memories not too long ago
